# Certificate Location Guide

## 📍 Where Are Your Certificates?

Your HTTPS certificates are stored in:

```
BookConnect/certs/
├── key.pem    (Private Key)
└── cert.pem   (Certificate)
```

**Full Path:**
```
C:\Users\aarya\OneDrive\Desktop\BookConnect_Final\BookConnect\certs\
```

## 🔐 Certificate Generation

Certificates are now generated when:
- ✅ A **NEW user** submits their **FIRST review**
- Each new user's first review triggers certificate generation
- The certificate is shared for the entire server (not per-user)

## 📝 How to View Your Certificates

### Option 1: File Explorer
1. Navigate to: `C:\Users\aarya\OneDrive\Desktop\BookConnect_Final\BookConnect\certs\`
2. You'll see:
   - `key.pem` - Private key file
   - `cert.pem` - Certificate file

### Option 2: PowerShell
```powershell
cd C:\Users\aarya\OneDrive\Desktop\BookConnect_Final\BookConnect\certs
dir
```

### Option 3: Command Prompt
```cmd
cd C:\Users\aarya\OneDrive\Desktop\BookConnect_Final\BookConnect\certs
dir
```

## 🔍 Verify Certificates Exist

You can check if certificates exist by looking at the console output when submitting a review:

```
🔐 New user "username" submitted their first review!
🔐 Generating HTTPS certificate...
✅ SSL certificate generated successfully!
   Generated by: username (User ID: ...)
   Certificate location: C:\Users\aarya\...\BookConnect\certs
   Key file: C:\Users\aarya\...\BookConnect\certs\key.pem
   Cert file: C:\Users\aarya\...\BookConnect\certs\cert.pem
```

## 🚀 Using HTTPS

After certificates are generated:
1. **Restart your server** (stop and start again)
2. The server will automatically detect the certificates
3. Access your app at: `https://localhost:3000` (instead of `http://localhost:3000`)

**Note:** Your browser may show a security warning because it's a self-signed certificate. This is normal for development. Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost" to continue.

## 🔄 Certificate Regeneration

- Certificates are regenerated when a new user submits their first review
- Existing certificates will be overwritten
- You need to restart the server after regeneration to use the new certificate
